# Towers-of-Hanoi
The objective of the game is to shift the entire stack of disks from one rod to another rod following these three rules: 
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time. Only 
2. the uppermost disk from one stack can be moved on to the top of another stack or an empty rod. 
3. Larger disks cannot be placed on the top of smaller disks.

Mips Machine Language and Python program do play the game by allowing the user to input any size tower and retrun the optimal number of moves and each move.
